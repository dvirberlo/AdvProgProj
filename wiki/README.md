# **Project Overview: Movie Streaming App**

## **Welcome to NextFelix!**

This application is a **dynamic movie streaming platform** built with **React, Android (Frontend)** and **Node.js, c++ (Backend)**, designed to replicate the functionality of real-world services like Netflix. It supports various user roles, has a beautiful UI/UX design, and integrates all major features such as user registration, login, movie watching, movie recommendations, and administrative controls.

## **Introduction**

This project simulates a real-world **movie streaming platform**. The goal is to create an application that allows users to browse movies, watch them, receive recommendations, and perform user-specific actions like logging in, registering, and managing content if they are administrators.

The design is inspired by Netflix, with a **responsive** interface suitable for both **desktop** and **mobile** screens. We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and role-based access control.

### **Frontend**
- **React**: For building the UI with reusable components for the web.
- **CSS (Styled Components)**: For responsive styling and modern UI.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user login, token management, and authentication across both web and mobile apps.
  
- **Android**: The mobile version of the app is built using **Java** for Android devices.
- **Retrofit**: Used for API communication with the backend to fetch movie data and manage user authentication.

### **Backend**
- **C++**: Smart recommendations engine for processing movie recommendations.
- **Node.js + Express**: Server-side framework for API handling.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data, movie details, etc.
- **JWT Authentication**: For securing endpoints and user authorization.

## **System Architecture**

The application is structured in the following layers:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React** app that communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs.
  - **Android** app built using **Java**, interacting with the same backend to provide a mobile experience.
- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js & Express** server that exposes API endpoints for user registration, login, and movie management.
- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB** database that stores users, movies, categories, and recommendations.
- **Authentication**: 
  - Secure user authentication using **JWT** tokens.

## **Role-Based Authentication**

### **User Roles**

#### **Regular User:**
- Can browse movies.
- Can watch movies and view recommendations.
- Cannot manage content.

#### **Admin User:**
- Has all user features.
- Can manage movies and categories through the admin panel.

### **JWT Authentication Flow**
1. **Login**: Upon successful login, the user receives a JWT token which is stored in the browser's local storage.
2. **Token Validation**: For each subsequent request, the JWT token is included in the request headers to validate user identity and permissions.
3. **Role-based Access**: Based on the user role (admin or regular), different functionalities are accessible (e.g., only admins can add/edit/delete movies).

---

## **Important Notes**

### **Validation:**
- All user inputs, including registration and login, are validated (e.g., name length, password strength, etc.).
- Feedback is provided for invalid inputs.

### **Security:**
- Passwords are securely hashed before storing.
- JWT tokens are used to protect sensitive data.

### **Responsive Design:**
- The app is fully responsive and adapts well to mobile and desktop views.
