# **Project Overview: Movie Streaming App**

## **Welcome to NextFelix!**

This application is a **dynamic movie streaming platform** built with **React, Android (Frontend)** and **Node.js, c++ (Backend)**, designed to replicate the functionality of real-world services like Netflix. It supports various user roles, has a beautiful UI/UX design, and integrates all major features such as user registration, login, movie watching, movie recommendations, and administrative controls.

## **Introduction**

This project simulates a real-world **movie streaming platform**. The goal is to create an application that allows users to browse movies, watch them, receive recommendations, and perform user-specific actions like logging in, registering, and managing content if they are administrators.

The design is inspired by Netflix, with a **responsive** interface suitable for both **desktop** and **mobile** screens. We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and role-based access control.

## **Features**

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the features available in the app:

### **User Features**

- **User Registration & Login**:
  - Sign up with necessary details (name, password, picture, etc.).
  - Login with username and password.
  - Profile picture is displayed on the home screen.
- **Movie Browsing**:
  - Browse movies by categories (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.).
  - Search movies by title.
  - View movie details including recommendations.
- **Watch Movies**:
  - Play movies directly from the application with a custom video player.
  - Watch full movies.
- **Dark/Light Mode**:
  - Switch between light and dark themes with a toggle button.

### **Admin Features**

- **Become an Admin**:

  - If you'd like to become an admin in the MongoDB database, follow these steps:
    1. Open **MongoDB Compass** and connect to your database.
    2. Navigate to the **"Users"** section and find your username in the list.
    3. Click on your username and, in the roles section, change your role to **"admin"**.
    4. Save the changes.
    5. After updating your role, **log out of the application**.
    6. Log back in, and you will now have admin access to manage movies and categories.

- **Manage Movies**:
  - Add, edit, or delete movies.
- **Manage Categories**:
  - Add, edit, or delete movie categories.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**

- **React**: For building the UI with reusable components for the web.
- **CSS (Styled Components)**: For responsive styling and modern UI.
- **JWT Authentication**: For secure user login, token management, and authentication across both web and mobile apps.
- **Android**: The mobile version of the app is built using **Java** for Android devices.
- **Retrofit**: Used for API communication with the backend to fetch movie data and manage user authentication.

### **Backend**

- **C++**: Smart recommendations engine for processing movie recommendations.
- **Node.js + Express**: Server-side framework for API handling.
- **MongoDB**: For storing user data, movie details, etc.
- **JWT Authentication**: For securing endpoints and user authorization.

---

## **System Architecture**

The application is structured in the following layers:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React** app that communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs.
  - **Android** app built using **Java**, interacting with the same backend to provide a mobile experience.
- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js & Express** server that exposes API endpoints for user registration, login, and movie management.
- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB** database that stores users, movies, categories, and recommendations.
- **Authentication**:
  - Secure user authentication using **JWT** tokens.

## **How to Run**

You can run the code using Docker in the following way:

1. Run a Mongo DB container (NOTE: the DB will start empty every time it is restarted)

```bash
docker-compose -f src/docker-compose.yml run --build --remove-orphans --service-ports --rm --name mongo mongo
```

2. Run the recommendation server (make sure the file `./data/user_data.txt` is deleted first)

```bash
docker-compose -f src/docker-compose.yml run --build --remove-orphans --service-ports --rm --name server-main server-main 8080
```

3. Create a config file at `./src/web-server/config/.env.production` with the relevant ports and addresses. If you follow our exact command, this should look like this:

```env
CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb://mongo:27017
PORT=3000
RECOMMEND_IP="server-main"
RECOMMEND_PORT=8080
JWT_PRIVATE_KEY=some_private_key
```

4. Run the web server (it will include the React client)

```bash
docker-compose -f src/docker-compose.yml run --build --remove-orphans --rm --name web-server -p 3000:3000 web-server
```

Now, you can access the web server through localhost at the specified port. For example:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api/categories
```

5. Now, you can browse the React client at `http://localhost:3000/`.

6. In addition, you can open `/src/android-client` in Android Studio and run the Android client on an emulator.

## **Role-Based Authentication**

### **User Roles**

#### **Regular User:**

- Can browse movies.
- Can watch movies and view recommendations.
- Cannot manage content.

#### **Admin User:**

- Has all user features.
- Can manage movies and categories through the admin panel.

### **JWT Authentication Flow**

1. **Login**: Upon successful login, the user receives a JWT token which is stored in the browser's local storage.
2. **Token Validation**: For each subsequent request, the JWT token is included in the request headers to validate user identity and permissions.
3. **Role-based Access**: Based on the user role (admin or regular), different functionalities are accessible (e.g., only admins can add/edit/delete movies).

---

## **Important Notes**

### **Validation:**

- All user inputs, including registration and login, are validated (e.g., name length, password strength, etc.).
- Feedback is provided for invalid inputs.

### **Security:**

- Passwords are securely hashed before storing.
- JWT tokens are used to protect sensitive data.

### **Responsive Design:**

- The app is fully responsive and adapts well to mobile and desktop views.
