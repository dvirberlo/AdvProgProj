## **Introduction**

This project simulates a real-world **movie streaming platform**. The goal is to create an application that allows users to browse movies, watch them, receive recommendations, and perform user-specific actions like logging in, registering, and managing content if they are administrators.

The design is inspired by Netflix, with a **responsive** interface suitable for both **desktop** and **mobile** screens. We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure authentication and role-based access control.
