# React Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Dev Documentations

We use [React 18](https://18.react.dev/), [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) for styling, and [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.size=24&icon.color=%23e8eaed&icon.platform=web&icon.style=Rounded&icon.set=Material+Symbols) for icons.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
